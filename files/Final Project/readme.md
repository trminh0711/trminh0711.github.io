CS-E4450 - Explorative Information Visualization D

INSTRUCTION TO LAUNCH VISUALIZATION (on Mac)
1. Open Final project folder in Visual Studio Code
2. Install extension Live Server
3. Right click on file sanitation.html, select Open with Live Server
4. The html page will be opened on a brower

In case of unsuccesful launching, the video Demo video gives a typical use case of the html webpage.

The sanitation.html was extended from my previous attempt in course DOM-E2113 Design and Data. However, there is a significant number of updates and changes that fulfills the number of hours dedicated to this project.
