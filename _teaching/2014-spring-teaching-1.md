[ELEC-A7151 Object oriented programming with C++](https://mycourses.aalto.fi/course/view.php?id=37295) (Autumn 2022) - Undergraduate course
======
This course is organized as a basic course in the C++ programming language. Its purpose is not to present you all the details of the language as a complete reference would do, but rather to summarize the basic syntax and features. Accordingly, the course content is divided into the following parts.

Setting up development environment for collaborative C++ development: In this part, you will be required to setup a development environment on your computer for the course. This part is a prerequisite for the other parts and you will be provided with detailed guidelines.

Basic C++ Programming Language features: In this part, the basic software constructs of the language will be introduced. It is composed of 5 online modules, which have several exercise assignments.

Programming project: At the end of the course, you will have a programming project assignment. The project will require you to use the C programming software constructs to reach the objectives of the assignment.
